        <p>P.S: We Need To Take More Photos Together...</p>
        <p>Developer Notes: These photos are not edited to be similar size so making this a responsive frontend site for mobile, tablet, and desktop got a bit tricky since the views are all the same size. I'll work on my photo editing skills for next year lol.
